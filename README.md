### About Me

- 👨‍💼 Software QC Engineer with over two years of experience in Manual, API, Database, and Test Automation. My expertise includes designing, executing, and analyzing test cases to identify and report defects. I am well-versed in a variety of testing tools and methodologies and always strive to ensure the quality and reliability of software products.
- ⚙️ Many of the automation projects I've worked on have been client-based and so private, but I want to focus more on open-source projects.
